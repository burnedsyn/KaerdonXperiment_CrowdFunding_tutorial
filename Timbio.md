Hi there, my name is Tim and I'm a computer programmer and herbalist. Just like Ob√©lix fell into the magic potion when he was a kid, I fell into computer tech when I was just 9 years old. Ever since then, I've been hooked on all things tech-related. My friends know me as a good listener and a very calm person who is skilled at finding creative solutions to any problem.

I specialize in web development and server management, and I'm proficient in web3 technologies such as blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized applications. I'm also well-versed in programming languages such as PHP, HTML/CSS, JS, and Solidity. In addition to fixing bugs and providing technical support, I am trained in computer science and have a keen eye for analyzing and improving upon projects.

If you've got a website or a web3 project that needs some TLC or a brand new one that needs to be built from scratch, don't hesitate to hit me up. I'm here to help with my technical skills and my friendly, caring personality. I'm an honest and patient guy, and my motto is "listen more than you speak." I love understanding and assisting others, and I'm always ready with a joke or two to lighten the mood. Let's work together and make magic happen!
